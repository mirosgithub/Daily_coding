# Daily_coding

This repository contains my solutions to coding problems from [Daily Coding Problem](https://www.dailycodingproblem.com/).

## Structure

Simple directory with numbered Python files:

```
/
├── 001.py
├── 002.py
├── 003.py 
└── ...
```

Each file contains:
- The problem statement as a docstring at the top
- My solution code
- Simple test cases

## Goals

- Solve one problem every day
- Improve algorithmic thinking
- Practice Python programming

## Running Solutions

Solutions can be run using Python:

```bash
python 001.py
```
